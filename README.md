# Hello! I'm Samhita Sarikonda 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, I share my hands-on projects in data science, cloud technologies, and geospatial analysis. Let’s connect and collaborate!

🎓 **Master’s Student in Data Analytics | :woman_technologist: Aspiring Data Scientist | 🧠 ML/NLP Enthusiast | 🚀 AI Explorer**

## **About Me**
💡 When I first embarked on my data journey, I didn’t know where it would lead—but I was fueled by curiosity and a desire to learn. I still remember how overwhelmed I felt when building my first data pipelines. Over time, what began as a daunting challenge became a passion for transforming raw information into actionable insights. 

Today, I work on solving complex data challenges with **machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data engineering**. Whether it's building recommendation systems or conducting geospatial analyses, I approach every project with a mindset of growth and continuous improvement. I believe data is more than just numbers—it tells a story, and I strive to make that story meaningful and impactful.

My journey has taken me from developing predictive maintenance solutions for IoT networks to performing NLP-driven sentiment analysis of user feedback. I believe that blending technical skills with curiosity helps create impactful solutions that drive smarter decisions.

## **What I've Been Working On from the day I started my Data Journey**

### **1. Geospatial Analysis of Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions**
🚀 Achieved 95% fraud detection accuracy by developing scalable workflows that processed millions of spatial data points and integrated machine learning models for geospatial fraud detection.
<br> 
🔧 *Technologies:* Python, PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake  

### **2. Market Basket Analysis for Product Recommendations**  
🚀 Developed an end-to-end recommendation system to address cold-start challenges for e-commerce platforms and Increased recommendation accuracy by 25% through an end-to-end system that processed large-scale customer transactions and used embedding-based models for product matching.
<br>
🔧 *Technologies:* Python, SQL, NLP, Scikit-learn, Annoy

## **What I do for Fun**
When I'm not working on data projects, I enjoy conducting workshops to foster data literacy, and exploring new cuisines in the kitchen. I also stay active by engaging in 🧘‍♀️ fitness activities that keep me energized and focused.
